I don't like how cluttered twitter's feed is all the time and much prefer ycombinator's [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) design. So I created a twitter UI that lets you view your timeline with a ycombinator type feel to it. I have a running instance you can sign into and if you don't trust me, you can view the source code for it as well (links below). Enjoy :)
