## [](#header-1)Introduction
Welcome to my first gardening blog post. I plan on documenting my progress as I begin learning and growing my own 2.5ft x 2.5ft garden. This week to help me learn more about the different parts of a plant, I will be documenting an inventory of the last salad I ate, picking out which parts of the salad were leaves, flowers, roots, stems, or fruits.

## [](#header-2)Salad Inventory
Below is a list of everything that was in my last salad, classified by their botanical definition:

### [](#header-3)Fruits
- Tomatoes
- Cucumber
- Avocado

### [](#header-3)Leaves
- Lettuce

### [](#header-3)Flowers
- Broccoli

I'm still in the process of building the 2.5ft x 2.5ft garden, but once it's done I'll have another post coming next week so stay tuned :)
