<p>This is my first time gardening, and actually my first time dealing with any sort of plant care, so I&rsquo;m very new to this, but also very excited to learn. I&rsquo;ve always sort of imagined my older self having a small garden in my backyard where I would grow food that I would use for my meals, being as environmentally friendly as I could. I&rsquo;m hoping this class will be a good introduction for me, and help me better understand the works that will go in to maintaining a garden.</p>
<h2 id="header-2what-i-hope-to-learn"><a href="#header-2"></a>What I Hope To Learn</h2>
<p>Like I said earlier, my goal for this class is to get a solid understanding of how to maintaing a basic garden. I&rsquo;m hoping I can learn how to grow all the various types of food, from herbs to vegetables and fruits, or at the very least, be given the foundational knowledge I need to continue learning about gardening. I also hope to learn more about how my gardening can be an environmental benefit, such as re-using food I would usually throw away for my garden.</p>
<h2 id="header-3beginning-stages"><a href="#header-3"></a>Beginning Stages</h2>
<p>Below is a picture of my garden setup so far. I cut together some pieces of wood for the walls, and used a wooden plank for the floor. I plan on grabbing some garbage bags to put between the soil and the wood, to prevent too much leaking and potentially warped wood.</p>

<p>Once I get the fertilizer and seeds, I can start growing!</p>
