<p>As I stated last week, my propagule was on the decline, and this week it met its end. I had transplanted it last week in hopes that it might just barely survive. This did not happen, however, and my celery gave its final breath. I&rsquo;ve let it stay in the garden, since it can help fertilize the soil. It&rsquo;s death shall help bring new life to future plants. Below is a picture of my decaying celery:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2020-11-22-Regrow-Project/1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As I stated last week, I still learned a lot from growing this propagule. I&rsquo;ll definitely be giving it a second attempt in the near future, and I think I&rsquo;ll have a better chance this time since I&rsquo;ll know what to expect. I may also try regrowing both celery and another plant, maybe sweet potatoe or pineapple (although I know that pineapple takes a loooong time to grow, but still would be fun). I also wouldn&rsquo;t mind regrowing one of the plants I already have in my garden once I harvest them. The sunflower might be a good option for that since I only have one growing at the moment.</p>
