<p>It&rsquo;s finally time to reap what I sowed! As I mentioned last week, I was planning on harvesting my radishes and I did exactly that. I harvested 3 out of the 6 I had growing, since the other 3 still needs time to grow a bit more. Looking back, I probably could&rsquo;ve waited another week or 2, but I was worried that they would be in the soil for too long and get spongy. Either way, I&rsquo;m really happy with how they turned out. The pole beans will be next, I&rsquo;m just waiting for them to get a bit more green. Below is a picture of the radishes before and after they were harvested.</p>

<p>This week, I also looked into keeping my plants from freezing, because of course being in Florida, that&rsquo;s a big worry (sarcasm). To be fair, it is getting a bit colder (40s) as we get close to December, so it might not be a bad idea to have a plan just in case, as I would like to continue keeping my plants alive during the winter and into spring. I designed an extremely complicated and advanced system that took hours to build. You can view the contraption below:</p>

<p>Yep. I put a zip lock bag on top of my plants. Simple, yet elegant. My plan for when I actually need to keep my plants warm is to cut a milk gallon jug in half and place that over the each plant. I think that design will be better for keeping it warm, but also have a much less likely chance of blowing away in the wind.</p>
