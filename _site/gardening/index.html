          <p>Upgrades This week I built a hydroponic system for my lettuce seedling. I used an empty 2 Liter bottle of sprite, cutting the upper third off with scissors and poking a hole in the bottle cap. I then put cotton wick through the hole in the bottle cap and tied...</p>

          <p>Transplanting! This week I transplanted my bell pepper and basil seedlings. The bell pepper seedling’s roots were starting to stick out of the peat pellet, so I knew it was time to move to the main garden. The basil seedlings probably could’ve stayed inside for a few more days, but...</p>

          <p>Casualty One of my bell pepper seedlings has unfortunately suffered a casualty. While on the window sill, the blinds fell directly onto my germination station, cutting one of the bell pepper seedlings in half. All that remains is the stem. I’ve left it there and have continued to water it...</p>

          <p>Everything is Growing! One of my onions finally sprouted and is visible through the soil! It’s now official: every type of plant I’ve sowed has sprouted! The radishes and pole beans sprouted very quickly, much quicker than any of the others had. My garden is starting to look more and...</p>

          <p>They’re Growing! Quite a lot happened this past week. After watering the seeds I planted daily, some of them broke ground! The sunflowers were the first to come up, growing way faster than any of the others. The basil was the next to come, still inside the peat pellets. Then,...</p>

          <p>Germination This week I finally started germinating my seeds. This is something I’ve never done before, so the whole process was very new to me.

          <p>My Background This is my first time gardening, and actually my first time dealing with any sort of plant care, so I’m very new to this, but also very excited to learn. I’ve always sort of imagined my older self having a small garden in my backyard where I would...</p>

          <p>Introduction Welcome to my first gardening blog post. I plan on documenting my progress as I begin learning and growing my own 2.5ft x 2.5ft garden. This week to help me learn more about the different parts of a plant, I will be documenting an inventory of the last salad...</p>
