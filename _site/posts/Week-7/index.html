<p>This week I transplanted my bell pepper and basil seedlings. The bell pepper seedling’s roots were starting to stick out of the peat pellet, so I knew it was time to move to the main garden. The basil seedlings probably could’ve stayed inside for a few more days, but I think they’ll be fine (knock on wood). I placed them in one of the corners of the garden, about 12 inches away from each other, making sure to water them thoroughly once transplanted. Below is a picture of my transplanted seedlings.</p>

<p>This week I also fertilized my plants, spreading about 1/4 teaspoon of fertilizer around each of my plants. I added more fertilizer than I was expecting, but that was the recommended amount, so we’ll see what happens. Based on things I’ve seen online (and other media in general), I thought only added a very very small amount of fertilizer would do the trick, and that adding too much could cause serious damage to your plants. Either way, I hope I put just the right amount. Below is a picture of my fertilized plants.</p>

<p>In other news, my pole beans seem to be dominating the garden, growing faster than any other plant. So much so, in fact, that its neighboring sunflowers seem to be suffering from lack of sunlight due to the large amount of shade the pole beans cast. I’ve been moving the sunflowers to the sunlight more and more often, so we’ll have to wait and see.</p>
