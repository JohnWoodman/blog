Command and Control is one of the most common techniques used by attackers to maintain persistent contorl over an infected computer, sending commands to be executed and recieving the output of those commands. There exists many different methods for implementing Command and Control, from using cloud services (AWS, Azure, etc.) to even using social media to send commands. One method we will be exploring is one I haven't seen before (probably for a good reason): using Spotify to send commands and recieve output.

## [](#header-1)Introduction

This project was inspired by a talk my good friend Terry Thibault ([@defnotprobro](https://twitter.com/defnotprobro) did at BSides Orlando, where he leveraged Twitter to send commands to an infected computer.

Command and Control essentially functions through a backdoor running on the infected machine, beaconing out every once in a while to retrieve a command or a set of commands to be executed. Commands sent to the beacon are usually encoded or hidden in some way (base64, hidden in an image, etc.) to make it harder for someone to detect. My method uses acrostics in Spotify playlists to send commands, and retrieves output through the description box available in those playlists.
