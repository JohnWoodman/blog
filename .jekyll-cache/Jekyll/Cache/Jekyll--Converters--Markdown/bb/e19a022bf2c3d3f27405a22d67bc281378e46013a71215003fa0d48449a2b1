I"i<h2 id="germination"><a href="#header-1"></a>Germination</h2>
<p>This week I finally started germinating my seeds. This is something I’ve never done before, so the whole process was very new to me. I started planting the following seeds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bell Peppers</li>
  <li>Zinnia</li>
  <li>Sun Flowers</li>
  <li>Basil</li>
  <li>Onion starters</li>
</ul>

<p>I germinated the bell peppers and basil seeds in peat pellets, which I placed indoors inside of an egg carton. This will allow it to grow enough to be transplanted to the main garden. The sun flower and zinnia seeds, as well as the onion starters were planted directly into the garden. I placed the sun flowers seeds a few inches apart and about 1/2 inch deep, the zinnia seeds a few inches apart and about 1/4 inch deep, and the oinon starter close together and about an inch deep into the soil.</p>

<p>I’m watering the peat pellets regularly, as they need to be well watered in order to grow enough to be transplanted. It should take about 7 days for it to be grown enough for transplanting. I’m watering the garden on a regular basis as well, but not as often as the peat pellets. Below is a picture of the peat pellets in the egg carton, as well as a picture of the garden (I added plant labels so I don’t forget what I planted where, and my awesome roommate contributed a nice little scarecrow):</p>
