<p>This week I transplanted my bell pepper and basil seedlings. The bell pepper seedling’s roots were starting to stick out of the peat pellet, so I knew it was time to move to the main garden. The basil seedlings probably could’ve stayed inside for a few more days, but I think they’ll be fine (knock on wood). I placed them in one of the corners of the garden, about 12 inches away from each other, making sure to water them thoroughly once transplanted. Below is a picture of my transplanted seedlings.</p>
