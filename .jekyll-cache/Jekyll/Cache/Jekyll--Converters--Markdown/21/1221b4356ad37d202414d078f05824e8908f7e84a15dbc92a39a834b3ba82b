<p>This week I finally started germinating my seeds. This is something Iâ€™ve never done before, so the whole process was very new to me. I started planting the following seeds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bell Peppers</li>
  <li>Zinnia</li>
  <li>Sun Flowers</li>
  <li>Basil</li>
  <li>Onion starters</li>
</ul>
