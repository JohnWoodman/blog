<p>Welcome to my first gardening blog post. I plan on documenting my progress as I begin learning and growing my own 2.5ft x 2.5ft garden. This week to help me learn more about the different parts of a plant, I will be documenting an inventory of the last salad I ate, picking out which parts of the salad were leaves, flowers, roots, stems, or fruits.</p>

<h2 id="salad-inventory"><a href="#header-2"></a>Salad Inventory</h2>
<p>Below is a list of everything that was in my last salad, classified by their botanical definition:</p>

<h3 id="fruits"><a href="#header-3"></a>Fruits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tomatoes</li>
  <li>Cucumber</li>
  <li>Avocado</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="leaves"><a href="#header-3"></a>Leaves</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Lettuce</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flowers"><a href="#header-3"></a>Flowers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Broccoli</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m still in the process of building the 2.5ft x 2.5ft garden, but once it’s done I’ll have another post coming next week so stay tuned :)</p>
