<p>Quite a lot happened this past week. After watering the seeds I planted daily, some of them broke ground! The sunflowers were the first to come up, growing way faster than any of the others. The basil was the next to come, still inside the peat pellets. Then, just a couple days ago, the zinnia broke through! The onion starters still havenâ€™t broken through yet, but Iâ€™m guessing those take longer to grow than the others, given the size. The bell peppers seeds still havenâ€™t come up in the peat pellets, which Iâ€™m a little worried about. Iâ€™m going to continue to water them and see what happens. Below you can see pictures of all the plants that have started growing.</p>
