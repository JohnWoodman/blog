<p>One of my bell pepper seedlings has unfortunately suffered a casualty. While on the window sill, the blinds fell directly onto my germination station, cutting one of the bell pepper seedlings in half. All that remains is the stem. Iâ€™ve left it there and have continued to water it in hopes that it may still survive. RIP for now, bell pepper seedling. Forever in our hearts.</p>
