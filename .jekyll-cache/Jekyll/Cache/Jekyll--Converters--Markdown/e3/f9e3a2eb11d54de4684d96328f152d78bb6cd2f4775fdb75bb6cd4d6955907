<p>One of my onions finally sprouted and is visible through the soil! It’s now official: every type of plant I’ve sowed has sprouted! The radishes and pole beans sprouted very quickly, much quicker than any of the others had. My garden is starting to look more and more like a garden everyday :). The sunflowers are still the tallest, but they’ve started drooping a little, so I’ll have to keep a watch on them. Below is a picture of my garden and me watering them. I poked holes in the top of a plastic milk gallon to use as watering can.</p>
