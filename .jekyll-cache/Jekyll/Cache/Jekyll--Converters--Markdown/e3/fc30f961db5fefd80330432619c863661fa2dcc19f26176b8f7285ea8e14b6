<p>Welcome to my first gardening blog post. I plan on documenting my progress as I begin learning and growing my own 2.5ft x 2.5ft garden. This week to help me learn more about the different parts of a plant, I will be documenting an inventory of the last salad I ate, picking out which parts of the salad were leaves, flowers, roots, stems, or fruits.</p>
