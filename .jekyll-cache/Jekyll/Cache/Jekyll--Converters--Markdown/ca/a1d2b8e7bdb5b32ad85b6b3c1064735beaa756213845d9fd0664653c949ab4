<p>This is my first time gardening, and actually my first time dealing with any sort of plant care, so I’m very new to this, but also very excited to learn. I’ve always sort of imagined my older self having a small garden in my backyard where I would grow food that I would use for my meals, being as environmentally friendly as I could. I’m hoping this class will be a good introduction for me, and help me better understand the works that will go in to maintaining a garden.</p>
